# test proxy web server written in python.

## what is it used for?
it serves a local server, which proxies requests from one domain to another.

this would allow a developer to work locally, and be able to route all requests
to `somedomain.com` to a server of their choice, eliminating the need to modify
the `/etc/hosts` file, or configuring local domain name servers.


## how does it work?
run the proxy server and navigate to the url http://localhost:3128/proxyserver.pac
file will best illustrate how the javascript-like syntax will work:
    `python server.py`
